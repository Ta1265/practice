'char' and "string" @#!@#!@# dont forget this!
strlen(str) // to get length
strings have built in comparison operations( ==, !=, etc..)
int myInt = std::stoi(myString)
myString.replace(index/from,1-single/to-multiple, replacement);



pointers- 
*pointers - pointers is the label for a memory address
&pointers - gives you that address of pointers 0x4453
pointer* - dereference a pointer - gets value stored at that pointer

regular function(param)
param is considered a constant at this point

pass-by-reference function(&param)
gives the function to modify the param at that memory location, meaning its changes arent only local

pass-by-pointer function(*param)
passes the item stored at the param memory location to be used locally

//hashmaps
// std::unordered_map<key-type, element-type> myMap
// m.insert(std::pair<type, type> (key,element));
