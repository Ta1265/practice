#Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
#
# 
#
#Example 1:
#
#Input: 5
#Output: 2
#Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
# 
#
#Example 2:
#
#Input: 1
#Output: 0
#Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
# 
#
#Note:
#
#The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
#You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
#This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/

        #find a number with oposit bits from num
        opositBits = 2**(len(binaryNum))-1 #<- length ^ 2  then -1 of our number gives us the number we need
        #use the built in python xor
